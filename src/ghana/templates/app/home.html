<h1>Welcome to the Ghana Hub</h1>
<h3>Give me a spin, I'm your Data Hub prototype in action!</h3>

<p>
	The <b>Data Hub</b> serves as a dynamic spatio-temporal information platform, tailored to the data practices of researchers in infectious diseases and public stakeholders engaged in epidemic preparedness and response.
	It offers an integrated view of various Data Layers relevant to <b>Ghana</b>, spanning multiple categories such as socio-demographic, environmental, weather, health, and infrastructure.
	These layers are compiled from user-based and open data sources (with some layers originating from the same source) to support data analysis and decision-making.
</p>

<p>
	The hub currently holds {{ shapes_count }} shapes, from the following types:
</p>
<ul>
{% for type in shape_types %}
	<li><a href="{{ type.get_absolute_url }}">{{ type.name }}</a> ({{ type.shapes.all.count }})</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-light">

	<b>Ghana Administrative Boundaries</b>

	<p>In 2019, the number of regions increased from 10 to 16. 173 districts existed in 2010 and 216 districts in 2017. Their number has grown to 260 by splits in 2018 and 2019. Guan was inaugurated as 261st district in October 2021.</p>

	<p>The geoshapefile of Ghana presented in this Data Hub is representing the map status prior October 2021. The data is sourced from Ghana Statistical Services (GSS) contributed by OCHA West and Central Africa (ROWCA) via the <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-gha">Humanitarian Data Exchange Platform</a> (HDX).</p>

<p>
	More details and in-depth documentation of each Data Layer can be accessed via its <a href="{% url 'datalayers:datalayer_index' %}">documentation page</a>, including metadata information.
