# Data Snack

### Crunching Digital Resources to Strengthen Global Health Research and Action

**Data Snack** is an initiative dedicated to empowering Global Health research, education, and action through leveraging digital resources and software tools. At the core of our work is the **Data Hub**, supported by various activities aimed at enhancing data collaboration across domains. Operating at the intersection of health and computer sciences, we collaborate with diverse stakeholders in research, data management, data analysis, epidemiology and public health.

**Juliane Boenecke** (she/her) | BSc, MSc | is a health scientist at BNITM (Department Infectious Disease Epidemiology, 2020) and visiting researcher at Charité Center for Global Health (Institute of Virology, 2024), driven by a passion for interdisciplinary and multimethod research in infectious disease epidemiology, specifically targeting epidemic preparedness and response within the One Health framework. Following her academic foundation with a BSc (Charité - University Medicine Berlin) and MSc (HAW Hamburg) in Health Sciences, she has built her expertise through diverse projects since 2017, spanning public health intelligence, data collaboration, and climate change and health. With her background as a physiotherapist, she adds a unique clinical perspective to her work. Juliane's career is further distinguished by her international collaborations across various disciplines in regions such as South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Through Data Snack, she is ambitious about developing innovative digital resources to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration and training, including the use of gamification, all while promoting an Open Science culture.

**Jonathan Ströbele** | BA, MSc | holds a MSc in Computer Science from Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW Hamburg), where he also completed his BA in Technical Computer Science. Before his studies he worked several years in the field of web development where he designed and built complex web applications for clients from various domains. This laid the foundation for a profound passion for open source, user-centered design, and participatory software development. During his Masters he worked as a research associate in different international, multi-domain projects, where he primarily focused on the development of a user-driven GIS web application (Data Hub) for processing heterogeneous data aiding epidemiological research and field work. Since 2023 he works as a computer scientist in the field of Global Health research, affiliated to the BNITM (Department Infectious Disease Epidemiology, 2023) and Charité Center for Global Health (visiting researcher at Institute of Virology, 2024), to continue developing the GIS framework and innovative software solutions in an interdisciplinary setting.
