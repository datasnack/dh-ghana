### Data provided by the Data Hub

The **DEMO Data Hub Ghana** hosts datasets under a wide range of licenses, ensuring compliance with the intellectual property rights of the various data sources utilized. Some datasets have been processed according to the needs of potential user groups. By accessing datasets through the **Data Hub** and/or the original source, users implicitly agree to abide by the terms of the applicable license specific to each dataset, as described in the dataset's **metadata**. This includes that when utilizing any data provided through the **Data Hub**, the data custodian shall be credited in the manner specified in the respective license and that relevant copyright provisions shall be complied with.


### Metadata

Complete metadata documentation for all data layers is available via the [Data Layers overview]({% url 'datalayers:datalayer_index' %}), including detailed descriptions, attribution requirements, and usage terms for each Data Layer. We are committed to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and currently follow metadata standards established by [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) and domain-specific guidelines for geospatial data. Our ongoing work focuses on improving metadata clarity and accessibility to better support [cross-domain collaboration](https://zenodo.org/records/11236871). Within the **Data Hub**, metadata is maintained by the project teams to ensure that project partners and third parties can gain a transparent understanding of the datasets — thereby strengthening data interoperability.

Please note that metadata provided in this demo environment is illustrative and may not be complete or fully accurate. It is shared without warranty and for demonstration purposes only.
